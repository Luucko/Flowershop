# **Flowershop (2023)**
## **Course:** Web Development Essentials
## **Tools used:** Laravel (PHP), MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was the final exam project for the Web Development Essentials course, where we had to extend a partially built front-end into a fully functioning e-commerce-style application with a Laravel-powered back-end. It was my first time building a full-stack app with Laravel, and it gave me a strong foundation in MVC structure, backend validation, database modeling, and transactional logic.

The assignment revolved around a fictional flower shop where users could browse and order individual flowers or combine them into bouquets. Each order triggered a confirmation email and had to be logged into a database. A big focus was also placed on error handling, user feedback, and proper validation both server- and client-side.

## **Key features I implemented:**

* **Relational data modeling** using Laravel migrations for flowers, bouquets, and orders
* **Dynamic creation and editing** of bouquets by selecting individual flowers
* **Order functionality** with form validation and email confirmation upon successful purchase
* **Server-side validation** with user-friendly error messages and clear client feedback
* **Order persistence** in a MySQL database, with real-time updates when changes occurred
* **Clean user feedback flows** for both success and failure scenarios (e.g., incorrect input, failed mail sending)

In addition to the back-end logic, I ensured my commits followed all Git best practices required during the exam—atomic, descriptive, and pushed regularly to GitLab. The final version passed all technical and functional criteria, and I was very happy with how smoothly the full-stack integration worked out.

This project challenged me to think about full lifecycle application logic—from user input, to server validation, to transactional integrity, and confirmation handling—while still applying front-end fundamentals. It marked a key moment in my growth as a web developer.
